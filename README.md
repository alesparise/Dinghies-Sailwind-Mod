**STOWING GUIDE:**  
First, buy the davits in the shipyard for the boat you want to stow the dinghy on. They are available on the Sanbuq, Junk, Brig and Jong.  
Have the dinghy close to the boat you want to stow it on. While on the boat, grab the "tarp cover" object and move it into the dinghy.
When the dinghy's model changes to the covered version, grab the hooks attached to the davits and click the metal brackets on the dinghy.
When both hooks are connected, you can use the davits winches to lift the boat out of the water.

To launch the dinghy, lower it using the winches, then click the hooks or the brackets to release them. 
When the dinghy is floating freely, click anywhere on the tarp cover to remove it. You can now use the dinghy as normal.
